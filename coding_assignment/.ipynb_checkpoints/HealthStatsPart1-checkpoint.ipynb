    "  Waist to hip ratio gives a prediction of the level of risk of developing heart disease or other serious health conditions. Is is calculated by taking your waist circumference in inches divded by hip circumference in inches. Ratios above 1 indicate that risk of developing heart disease is much higher than ratio below 1. Ratio is also used to indicate obesity.  Women with ratios above 0.85 and men with ratios above .90 are obese.\n",

Also waist to hip ratio measures risk of mortality as well.    \n",
